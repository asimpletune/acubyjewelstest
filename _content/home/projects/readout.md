# readout
A tool for inserting markdown content into your site as HTML

This project is extremely early in its development. The premise is when it comes to writing actual content, you probably don't need anything besides markdown. As a huge fan of it, I'd like to be able to write all of my word-stuff in good ol' markdown.

What you see so far is just a very rough prototype, but it gets the job done. More to come.
