Hello and welcome to my site! This site is about whatever makes Spence to me, thanks for coming.

I'm a software developer working and living in San Francisco. I transplanted from Austin, TX, where I went to college for computer science, but also studied other things. Although life in Austin was really cool, I wanted to see what's going on here SF for myself.

My HQ is in the presidio, which only took 11 months to find, where I live with my roommates. There's a lot of jokes going around here (our household), ping pong, grab-ass, and screaming for no reason. It's a nightmare.

Most of my hobbies revolve around making stuff, fixing things, and being silly. So besides programming, this includes chilling in my workshop while building shit, writing music, working on our house golf carts, etc... I also really like to clean?

Currently, I'm on sabbatical, preparing to travel the American continent(s) in my 1969 VW bus.

In general, I feel like a very multi-dimensional person. Software development happens to be my career, but in terms of an "occupation" I'm an artist too. My hopes for this website is to have a space to just be myself. I also hopefully other people might like it too, thanks for checking it out.
