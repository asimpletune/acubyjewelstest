## Work Experience

#### MTS Systems Engineer, Salesforce.com, May 2015 - Jan 2016
* Worked on an in-memory, distributed, graph-based database to model state of next-generation data centers
  * Designed method for continuing development ahead of having customer requirements, using an intermediary query language and client-specified schemas
  * Helped design/code MVP using go, protobuf, and embedded consul.io consensus library
  * MVP handled multiple-thousand requests per second, guaranteeing strong consistency, while tolerating benign faults
* Owned a platform for integrating internal, legacy development/bug-tracking tools with GitHub enterprise (**architecture and engineering - personal project**)
  * Handled authentication across platforms
  * Elegantly supported how to grandfather-in bugs tracked prior to this system, requiring no user intervention
  * Devised a way of extending new functionality through meta-data, for future-proofing further development
* Evangelized Docker development
  * Consulted with cloud architects on canonical Docker development practices
  * Reviewed Docker related code outside of team
  * Developed curriculum for in-house docker training material

#### MTS Software Engineer, Salesforce.com, Oct 2014 - Apr 2015
* Worked on a next-generation, internal CI system
  * Product scope was build/test/reporting across three platforms: web (Linux), iOS, and Android
  * Featured auto-scaling elastic compute resources, heavily parallelized builds/test-runs, self-service support and customized compute environments
  * Owned design/development of a templating system that allowed teams to customize and maintain their test environments as code in GitHub
* Owned an OS X elastic compute service (**architecture and engineering - personal project**)
  * Services run on top of highly available, gossip protocol layer, which provides consensus primitives
  * Clean API served authenticated, parameterized CRUD operations on compute nodes
* Served as team scrum master, mentored intern, moved team from Vagrant to Docker, and wrote team site
  * Advocated creating a team site as a top priority, which reduced time team spent on support by ~25%

#### AMTS Software Engineer, Salesforce.com, Jan 2014 - Sept 2014
* Named as an inventor on a patent with provisional status
* Full stack development of new features for Salesforce "Knowledge" (product)
* Fixed bugs, refactored old code, and wrote test automation

#### Software Engineering Co-op, Intel Corporation, May 2012 - Jan 2014
* Owned development of automatic robotic part handlers for post silicon validation (**architecture and engineering - personal project**)
  * Developed reliable pathfinding, self-calibration, and part handling capabilities for two $25K+ 6-axis robots
  * Abstracted work out to a robotic SDK that allowed different classes of robots (*6-axis, cartesian, etc...*) to be used interchangeably
  * Integrated with interlocks, emergency switches, part-reading camera, vacuum suction cups, and part actuators to run and record results of automated test in a database
* Wrote GUI app for analogue test engineers to interface, via Modbus protocol, with thermal controllers

#### Software Engineering Intern, Salesforce.com, May 2013 - August 2013
* Wrote majority of the front end development for Salesforce Knowledge's redesign which shipped into production
* Extracted separate device views into a single, responsive view across devices, which saved time spent on development and maintenance in the future

#### Student Technology Assistant, UT Austin, May 2010 - Jan 2011
* Code PHP, CSS, JS, HTML for departmental websites at UT Austin

## Education

##### University of Texas at Austin, December 2013
*College of Natural Sciences*, **Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science**

* **Thesis**: *Using DSP to Determine Volume of Containers*
* Selected Projects:
  * Implementation of Multi-Paxos
  * Program in asm that deletes everything in memory, including itself
  * Demonstration of how Bellman-Ford can beat Dijkstra by exploiting techniques learned in graduate-level performance class
